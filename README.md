# Arena Mayhem

Welcome to Arena Mayhem! This repository contains two distinct applications: Arena Mayhem with a user interface and Arena Mayhem's backend. These apps were developed as a proof of concept for a hackathon, bringing you an exciting world of gladiator battles and blockchain technology.

## Overview

In both apps, Arena Mayhem offers an exhilarating fighting game that allows users to create their own gladiators and challenge their friends or CPUs to epic battles. To enter the arena, participants stake a chosen amount of tokens, which should be ERC-20 tokens like ETH, APE, or any other following the protocol.

### How it Works

1. **Betting and Staking:** Users set their bets using tokens, creating an enticing wager for the battle.
2. **Battle Commencement:** The battle issuer and challenger can enter the arena, and the Cartesi machine springs into action to execute a complex algorithm.
3. **Battle Log Generation:** The Cartesi machine generates a detailed battle log in JSON format, reflecting each gladiator's actions and statistics.
4. **Winner Takes All:** if the player's gladiator wins they can claim the prize.

### Why Cartesi?

We chose Cartesi to run the battle logic because it allows for the implementation of intricate and complex algorithms, which might be challenging to accomplish using the Solidity language.

### Witness the Battle

After the algorithm finishes its calculations and log generation, players can watch their gladiators in action through a captivating animation created with the React frontend. Every step of the fighters' attacks and the gradual decay of their health is displayed throughout the battle.

### Claim Your Victory

When the battle concludes, tokens are distributed within the application and can be easily withdrawn by the winner. Arena Mayhem is your gateway to a world of exhilarating battles, strategic gameplay, and the taste of victory!

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: The entire frontend is developed with React. All assets, including fonts, images, and sprites for animations, are sourced from the internet.

- **Backend**: The backend is developed using Python and runs inside the Cartesi machine. This version only performs battles without staking of betting

- **Frontend-Backend Interaction**: The frontend interacts with the backend within the "arena-node" directory, built with Sunodo.

- **Alternative Backend**: An alternative backend, not yet integrated with the frontend, can be found in the "rollups-examples/auction" directory. This version is built on top of the auction app from Rollups examples. This version is the one that integrates functions such as deposits and withdraws. 

## Getting Started

Each project comes with a dedicated README file, providing detailed instructions on how to run and interact with the applications.

So, gear up, step into the arena, and experience the thrill of Arena Mayhem!üèÜü•ä
